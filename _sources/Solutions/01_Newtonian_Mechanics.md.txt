# Assignment 1: Newtonian Mechanics

## Rockets

Consider a rocket of mass $m(t)$ which ejects fuel at a rate of $\dot{m}(t) \leq 0$.  Assume that all of the fuel is ejected with speed $v_e$ directed in the $-x$ direction relative to the rocket.

1. Carefully justify the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation derived in class for a rocket
    moving in one dimension without gravity (or air resistance):
   
    \begin{gather*}
      v(t) = v(0) + v_e\ln\frac{m(0)}{m(t)}.
    \end{gather*}

    :::{solution}

    To avoid any issue with how to apply Newton's laws with changing mass, we model the
    problem in a way we *know* how to solve.  We consider the rocket ejecting chunks of
    mass $\Delta{m} > 0$ with relative speed $v_e > 0$ in the negative direction every
    $\Delta{t}$ in time.  Conserving momentum before and after the ejection, we have:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      p = mv = \Delta{m}(v-v_e) + (m-\Delta{m})(v + \Delta{v}),\\
      v_e \Delta{m} = m\Delta{v} - \Delta{m}\Delta{v},\\
    \end{gather*}
    
    where $v(t+\Delta{t}) = v + \Delta{v}$ is the new velocity after ejecting the chunk.
    Collecting terms, and assuming that $\Delta{m}$ and $\Delta{v}$ are of the same
    order, we can cancel the $mv$ and $\Delta m v$ terms, drop the $\Delta{m}\Delta{v}$ term, and
    divide by $\Delta{t}$ to obtain the following which becomes exact when we take
    the limit $\Delta{m} \sim \Delta{v} \sim \Delta{t} \rightarrow 0$ while holding
    fixed $\Delta{m}/\Delta{t} = -\dot{m}$ and $\Delta{v}/\Delta{t} = \dot{v}$:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      v_e \overbrace{\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}}^{-\dot{m}(t)} 
      = m \overbrace{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}}^{\dot{v}(t)} 
      - \overbrace{\frac{\Delta m \Delta v}{\Delta t}}^{0}
      \rightarrow  -v_e\dot{m}(t) = m\dot{v}(t), \\
     \diff{v(t)}{t} = -v_e\frac{1}{m(t)}\diff{m(t)}{t} = -v_e \diff{}{t}\ln m(t).
    \end{gather*}
    
    Note how the two forms of Newton's law appear here in terms of the thrust:
    
    \begin{align*}
      m\dot{v} &= - v_e\dot{m} = F_e,\\
      \diff{p}{t} &= v\dot{m} + m \dot{v} = (v - v_e)\dot{m}.
    \end{align*}
    
    Here $F_e = - v_e \dot{m} \geq 0$ is called the **thrust of the rocket** and is the
    force as measured in the frame of the rocket.  This enters the $F=ma$ form of
    Newton's law.  Conversely, $(v-v_e)\dot{m}$ is in some sense the thrust in the
    inertial frame.
    
    Dimensionally these expression are correct, and it satisfies the following limits:

    1. $v_e = 0$ implies no acceleration, and increasing $v_e$ increases the acceleration.
    2. $\dot{m} = 0$ implies no acceleration and increasing $\dot{m}$ implies increasing
        acceleration. 
    3. $\dot{m}(t) < 0$ which gives a positive acceleration.
    4. The maximum velocity is unbounded if $m(t) \rightarrow 0$.  It is not limited by $v_e$.
    5. The equations have the form $m(t)\dot{v}(t) = - v_e\dot{m}(t) = F_e(t)$ where $F_e(t)
        = -v_e \dot{m}$ is the **thrust** of the rocket.  Thus, in this case, the $F_e =
        ma$ form of Newton's law seems to be correct rather than $F = \dot{p} = \dot{m}
        v + m a$ unless you define the external force to be $F_{\mathrm{ext}} =
        (v-v_e)\dot{m}(t)$, which *may* be defensible as this is the change in momentum
        in the inertial frame... however, relying on such arguments is asking for
        trouble.  Break the problem into parts that you are certain about to be safe.
        *A priori, I might have suspected that $\dot{p} = F_e$ would correctly describe
        a rocket, but this is not the case.  Working through from what I *know to be
        true*, I am convinced with the answer, even though it disagrees with my
        intuition about the $\dot{p} = F$ form of Newton's law being more generally
        correct.*
        
        From another perspective, one might think that, since there is no external
        force, we should have:
        
        \begin{gather*}
          F_{\mathrm{ext}} = \dot{p} = 0 = \dot{m} v + m \dot{v}, \qquad
          \dot{v} = -v \frac{\dot{m}}{m},
        \end{gather*}
        
        which is almost correct, but one needs to identify $v$ on the right-hand-side
        with $v_e$, for which I do not see a compelling argument.

    Integrating, we have the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation
    
    \begin{gather*}
      \int_{v(0)}^{v(t)} \d{v} = -\int_{\ln m(0)}^{\ln m(t)} v_e \d{\,\ln m(t)}\\
      v(t) - v(0) = -v_e \ln \frac{m(t)}{m(0)} = v_e \ln \frac{m(0)}{m(t)}.
    \end{gather*}
    
    :::

2. This formula is independent of the rate $\dot{m}(t)$ at which fuel is expelled.
    Explain how this result is consistent with the simple formula for the velocity of the
    rocket if all of the fuel were to be immediately eject as one blob with speed $v_e$:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      v(t>0) = v_i + v_e\frac{m(0) - m(t)}{m(t)}.
    \end{gather*}
   
    :::{solution}
    
    In both cases, the total momentum is conserved $p = m(0)v(0)$, however, in this
    case, all of the fuel has velocity $v_i -v_e$ whereas with continuous emission, the
    ejected fuel has a range of velocities from $v_i-v_e$ at the beginning to $v_f - v_e$
    at the end.  Once the rocket is moving, ejecting fuel is never as efficient at
    accelerating the rocket as it was before.
    
    Another way of thinking about this is that when continuously ejecting the fuel, the
    initially ejected fuel must accelerate both the rocket and the remaining fuel.  In
    all the fuel can be ejected at once, this accelerates just the payload, and is much
    more efficient.
    
    This is supported by calculating the energy require to eject the fuel.  If the fuel
    is ejected suddenly, this is simply the kinetic energy of the fuel. In the
    continuous burn scenario, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy imparted
    to each chunk of fuel $\Delta m v_e^2/2$ integrated over time:
    
    \begin{align*}
      E_{\text{continuous}} &= \sum \frac{\Delta m}{2} v_e^2 
      = \int_0^{t} \frac{v_e^2}{2} \dot{m} \d{t} 
      = v_e^2 \bigl(m(t) - m(0)\bigr),\\
      E_{\text{sudden}} &= \frac{m(t)-m(0)}{2}v_e^2.
    \end{align*}
    
    Thus, the energy expenditure of both rockets is the same (ignoring loss), but all of
    is used to accelerate the payload in the sudden launch case, whereas a significant
    portion goes into accelerating the fuel in the continuous launch case.
    
    Note, it is **not** valid to consider these equations as consistent by considering a
    limiting case – $m(t) - m_0$ is generally not small, although, the two expressions
    do approach the same form in the $m(t) \approx m_0$ limit.  These two situations are
    generally very different.
    
    :::
   
3. Derive the equation of motion for the rocket moving vertically in a gravitational
   field.
   
    :::{solution}
    
    We must add the acceleration due to gravity $g>0$ to the rocket equation:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      \ddot{z}(t) = \diff{v(t)}{t} = - v_e\frac{\dot{m}(t)}{m(t)} - g
      = - v_e\diff{}{t}\ln m(t) - g.
    \end{gather*}
    :::

4. Solve these equations for a rocket moving vertically in a constant gravitational
   field.  Assume that $\dot{m}(t) = \dot{m}$ is constant and find the height $z(t)$.
   
    :::{solution}
    
    We can still integrate the first equation as before:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      v(t) - v(0) 
        = -\int_{m(0)}^{m(t)}\d{m} v_e \ln m - \int_0^t \d{t} g\\
        = -v_e \ln\frac{m(t)}{m(0)} - gt,
    \end{gather*}
    
    which is valid for any $\dot{m}(t)$.  To integrate this further, however, we must
    now know the form of $m(t)$.  For constant $\dot{m}$, we have $m(t) = m(0) + \dot{m}
    t$, hence:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      \dot{z}(t) = v(t) = v(0) + v_e \ln\frac{m(0)}{m(0) + \dot{m} t} - gt\\
      z(t) = z(0) + v(0) t - \frac{g}{2}t^2 
             + v_e \int_{0}^{t}\ln\frac{1}{1 + \frac{\dot{m}}{m(0)} t}\d{t}\\
           = z(0) + v(0) t - \frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_e t - v_e\left(\frac{m(0)}{\dot{m}} +
             t\right)\ln \left(1 + \frac{\dot{m}}{m(0)} t\right)\\
           = z(0) + v(0)t - \frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_e t - v_e\frac{m(t)}{\dot{m}}\ln \frac{m(t)}{m(0)}.
    \end{gather*}
    
    This form is only valid for constant $\dot{m}(t)$.  Some checks:
    
    1. It has the correct dimensions.
    2. If $v_e$ is zero, the rocket falls as expected:
    
       \begin{gather*}
         z(t) = z(0) + v(0)t - gt^2/2.
       \end{gather*}
       
    3. The sign of the last two terms needs careful consideration.  $\dot{m} < 0$ and
       $m(t) < m(0)$, so we can make the signs manifest by some rearrangements.  We can
       also compare with the $-gt^2/2$ term if we use $t = (m(t) - m(0))/\dot{m}$.
       Finally, we consider the initial motion for small $t$ so that $\epsilon =
       1-m(t)/m(0) \ll 1$.  In this limit, we have $\ln(1-\epsilon) = -\epsilon
       -\epsilon^2/2 + \cdots$, hence:
       
       \begin{gather*}
         -\frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_et - v_e \frac{m(t)}{\dot{m}}\ln \frac{m(t)}{m(0)}\\
         = - \frac{g m^2(0)}{2\dot{m}^2}\epsilon ^2 + \frac{v_e m(0)}{-\dot{m}}
         \left(\epsilon + (1-\epsilon)\ln(1-\epsilon)\right)\\
         \approx - \frac{g m^2(0)}{2\dot{m}^2}\epsilon ^2 
                 + \frac{v_e m(0)}{-\dot{m}}\frac{\epsilon^2}{2}.
       \end{gather*}
       
       Thus, we have liftoff iff we have enough thrust
       
       \begin{gather*}
         \frac{v_e m(0)}{-2\dot{m}} > \frac{g m^2(0)}{2\dot{m}^2}, \\
         F_e = -v_e \dot{m} > g m(0).
       \end{gather*}
       
    :::
    
5. **Bonus**: Briefly estimate how much energy is required to place a payload of $1$kg
    into a geosynchronous orbit.  How does this depend on the overall mass of the rocket
    (i.e. is it more efficient to send several small rockets or a single large rocket?
   
    :::{solution}
    
    Consider trying to launch a rocket with constant $\dot{m}$ and $v_e$.  We shall
    consider the solution at time $t$ when the fuel $m_f$ is completely burned and all
    that remains is the payload $m_p = m(t)$:

    \begin{gather*}
      m_0 = m_p + m_f, \qquad
      t = -\frac{m_f}{\dot{m}}.
    \end{gather*}

    To simplify the problem, we introduce dimensionless variables including the mass
    fraction of the final rocket $\mu = m_p/m_0$ and the initial "gees" $n =
    \ddot{z}(0)/g = T/m_0g = -v_e\dot{m}/gm_0$ -- the acceleration at time $t=0$ in
    units of $g$.  Starting with $z_0 = \dot{z}_0 = 0$, we have at the burnout time $t =
    v_e(1-\mu)/ng$:

    \begin{gather*}
      \frac{\dot{z}}{v_e} = \frac{\mu-1}{n} - \ln \mu, \qquad
      \frac{z}{v_e^2/g} = - \frac{(1-\mu)^2}{2n^2} + \frac{1}{n} 
          + \frac{\mu}{n}(\ln\mu - 1).
    \end{gather*}

    At this point the rocket will continue to coast in free-fall and has energy per unit mass:

    \begin{gather*}
      \frac{E}{m_p v_e^2} = \frac{\dot{z}^2}{2v_e^2} + \frac{gz}{v_e^2}
                          = \frac{(\ln\mu)^2}{2} + \frac{1+\ln\mu - \mu}{n}.
    \end{gather*}

    This is the energy that must be used to overcome the total gravitational potential
    energy of the payload.  Note that the last term is always negative since $\mu \in
    (0,1)$, hence we can maximize the energy by taking $n \rightarrow \infty$.  I.e. we
    burn the rockets as quickly as possible (like shooting a bullet from a gun).  In
    this limit we obtain the maximum energy:

    \begin{gather*}
      E_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{m_p v_e^2}{2}\frac{(\ln\mu)^2}{2}
    \end{gather*}
    
    A geosychronous orbit has a radius of about $R_{GS} \approx 4\times 10^7$m where the
    orbital frequency $\omega_{GS} = \sqrt{GM_{e}/R_{GS}^3} = 2\pi / $(24 hours), to be
    compared with the radius of the earth $R_e \approx 6\times 10^6$m. If one simply
    uses an estimate of the potential energy required to lift a payload up to a
    geosynchronous orbit, one finds $\Delta E \approx 5\times 10^7$J for 1kg.

    To simplify the approximation we note that $g_{GS} \approx 0.25$m/s$^2$ and assume a
    constant gravitational field with $g_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim 1$m/s$^2$.  To compare, this
    gives a potential difference of $\Delta E = mgh = 3\times 10^7$J so this is of the
    same order of magnitude.  *(Note, however, that if you treat $g = 9.8$m/s$^2$ as
    constant you get $\Delta E \approx 3.5\times 10^8$J which is an order of magnitude
    too large.)*

    However, in addition to the potential energy gain, we must give our payload enough
    kinetic energy to stay in orbit with speed $v_{GS} = R_{GS}\omega_{GS} \approx
    3$km/s.  If we launch from the equator, the rocket already has speed $v_0 =
    R_{e}\omega_{GS} = 0.5$km/s, so we get a small advantage, but still need to provide
    a considerably velocity of $v_f=2.5$km/s at the top of the orbit corresponding to an
    additional kinetic energy of $3\times 10^6$J for 1kg.

    Imagine we can launch the rocket up, and have some slick mechanism at the top to
    change direction without rockets (perhaps a tether attached to a massive satelite
    already in orbit).  We then can use our previous equation to estimate the mass of
    fuel required by solving for the final require velocity $v_f$ and height $h =
    R_{GS} - R_e = 3.6\times10^7$m.  Assuming all the fuel is burned, we then have $m(t)
    = m_p$

    \begin{gather*}
      v_f = - g_{\mathrm{eff}}t + v_e\ln\frac{m_0}{m_p},\\
      v_e\ln\frac{m_0}{m_p} = v_f + g_{\mathrm{eff}}t, \\
      h = - \frac{g_{\mathrm{eff}}t^2}{2} + v_e t - v_e \frac{m_p}{\dot{m}}\ln\frac{m_p}{m_0}
        = - \frac{g_{\mathrm{eff}}t^2}{2} + v_e t + \frac{m_p}{\dot{m}}(v_f + g_{\mathrm{eff}}t)
    \end{gather*}

    where $x = \ln m_0/m_p$.

    To estimate this, we need some information about typical rockets.  The Saturn V
    produced a thrust of about $T=10^8$N$ = -\dot{m} v_e$ with an exhaust velocity of
    about $v_e \approx 1$km/s, hence $\dot{m} \approx 10^5$kg/s.

## Elliptical Orbits

As Kepler showed†, a particle orbiting in gravitational potential $V(r) = \alpha/r$ will
move along an ellipse.  Will the center of mass of an extended object also move in a
perfect ellipse?  Provide a **concise** and convincing argument that this will be the
case, or provide a simple counter example.

† *I do not require you to show it here, but I also expect **you** to be able to derive
and explain all of Kepler's laws from Newton's law, reducing the 6 degrees of freedom of
the original 2-body problem to a single effective equation for the relative coordinate
$r$ in terms of the reduced mass, etc.  I will likely ask you about this during one of
your exams.*

:::{solution}

Consider a barbell consisting of two masses $m$ connected by a massless rod of length
$2d$.  If you work out the equations of motion for this you will find that the equations
of motion for the center of mass do not decouple from the rotation of the barbell,
showing that barbell rotation will affect the orbit.

As a really simple example, consider an asymmetric barbell with masses $m$ and $M$
lying along the $x$-axis with $m$ closer at distance $r_0 - d$ and the center or
mass at distance $r$: 

\begin{align*}
  r &= \frac{m(r_0-d) + M(r_0+d)}{m+M} = r_0 + \overbrace{\frac{M-m}{m+M}}^{\mu} d, &
  r_0 &= r - \mu d,\\
  F_{0} &= -\lambda\left(\frac{m}{(r_0-d)^2} + \frac{M}{(r_0+d)^2}\right),\\
        &= -\lambda\left(\frac{m}{[r - (\mu + 1) d]^2} + \frac{M}{[r - (\mu - 1) d]^2}\right).
\end{align*}

Compare this with the barbell rotated by $\pi$ radians so $m_2$ is closest

\begin{align*}
  r &= \frac{M(r_0-d) + m(r_0+d)}{m+M} = r_0 - \mu d, &
  r_0 &= r + \mu d,\\
  F_{\pi} &= -\lambda\left(\frac{m}{(r_0+d)^2} + \frac{M}{(r_0-d)^2}\right),\\
          &= -\lambda\left(\frac{m}{[r + (\mu + 1) d]^2} + \frac{M}{[r + (\mu - 1) d]^2}\right).
\end{align*}

These are not the same (plug in some numbers), meaning that the net central force
depends on the orientation of the barbell.

This particular calculation does not show the dependence on the angle if $m=M$, but we
demonstrate that even in this case, elliptical orbits are not generally supported with a
numerical demonstration.  *Note: you must carefully check that your integrator is
accurate -- in this case, setting $d$ much larger than that specified will produce
extreme sensitivity (maybe chaos, but I have not computed the Lyapunov exponent),
rendering long-term integration inaccurate.*

The position and velocity of the rod can be expressed in terms of the center of mass
coordinate $r = x+\I y$ and the angle $\phi$ of the rod.  I will work with complex
numbers to simplify the numerical implementation.  Given two vectors represented as
complex numbers $a$, $b$, the cross-project $\vect{a}\times \vect{b} = (a_x b_y - a_y
b_x)\uvect{z}$ magnitude is given by the imaginary part $\Im[ \bar{a} b] = \Im[(a_x - \I
a_y)(b_x + \I b_y)]$.

## Central Potentials

Throughout the course we will visit the problem of a Harmonic Oscillator: i.e. the motion of a particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V(r) = \tfrac{1}{2}kr^2$ which might represent a ball connected to an anchored spring with spring constant $k$.  We shall revisit this problem in all formalisms and use it as a basis for understanding chaotic dynamics.

1. Use the effective potential to show that all orbits are bound and that $E$ must
    exceed $E_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{kl^2/m}$ where $l$ is the angular momentum of the
    system.
   
    :::{solution}

    Following the usual arguments, conservation of angular momentum $l = mr^2\dot{\phi}$
    and energy $E$ allows us to work with polar coordinates in a plane containing the
    motion with the potential at the origin.  In terms of these coordinates, the energy
    is: 

    \begin{gather*}
      E = \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 + \overbrace{\frac{l^2}{2mr^2} + \frac{k}{2}r^2}^{V_{\text{eff}}(r)}.
    \end{gather*}

    Since the kinetic energy is positive, one has:

    \begin{gather*}
      E \geq E_{\min} = \min_{r}\frac{l^2}{2mr^2} + \frac{k}{2}r^2.
    \end{gather*}

    Extremizing this last term, we find that the minimum occurs for $r=r_0$ with

    \begin{gather*}
      r_0^2 = \sqrt{\frac{l^2}{km}} = \frac{l}{m\omega}, \qquad
      E_{\min}(r_0) = \sqrt{\frac{kl^2}{m}} = l\omega.
    \end{gather*}

    This is the radius of the circular orbit.  To connect with the usual quantum
    mechanical formulation, we have used $k = m\omega^2$. 

    Unlike with the Coulomb or Newton potentials, the HO potential increases without
    bound, thus, any give orbit is bound below $r \lesssim \sqrt{2E/k} =
    \sqrt{2E/m\omega^2}$ (valid for large $r$ or $E$).
    
    :::
    
2. Verify that the orbit is a closed ellipse with the origin at the center of the
    potential.  (Compare your result with the formulas in the book for problem 1.10 (b).)

    :::{solution}

    That the orbits are closed should be clear from the special property of the harmonic
    oscillator is that the motion in each direction separates:

    \begin{gather*}
      m \ddot{\vect{r}} = - m \omega^2\vect{r}, \\
      m \ddot{x} = -m \omega^2 x, \qquad
      m \ddot{y} = -m \omega^2 y, \qquad
      m \ddot{z} = -m \omega^2 z.
    \end{gather*}

    Using the conservation of angular momentum, we can as usual consider the motion in
    the $xy$ plane with the solution:

    \begin{gather*}
      x(t) = \frac{v_x(0)}{\omega}\sin(\omega t) + x(0) \cos(\omega t), \\
      y(t) = \frac{v_y(0)}{\omega}\sin(\omega t) + y(0) \cos(\omega t).
    \end{gather*}

    Thus, the period of the $x$ and $y$ motions are the same, and the orbit will close.
    We can also see from this solution, that the trajectory will be an ellipse centered
    on the potential and that the period of the orbit $T_\phi = 2\pi/\omega =
    2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$ will be twice the period of radial oscillation $T_r = T_\phi/2$ from
    $r_-$ to $r_+$ and back.  We also see that the period $T_\phi$ is independent of $E$
    and $l$, the simple result alluded to in part 3. of the problem.  Note, that this
    does not simply follow from dimensional arguments since there is a dimensionless
    parameter $\kappa = E/l\omega$ to be discussed below that could in principle alter
    the period.  It turns out, however, that the period does not depend on this
    quantity.
    
    :::
    
    :::{solution} Alternative Solution: Radial Equation

    The previous approach suffices as a complete
    solution, but we can also derive this the long way directly from the radial
    equation, integrating from the point of closest approach $r_-$ at time $t=0$ when
    $\phi = 0$, to the point of furthest approach $r_+$ at time $t=t$ where
    $V_e(r_{\pm}) = E$ and $\phi = \phi$.

    \begin{gather*}
      \dot{r} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}}\sqrt{E - V_e(r)}
      = \diff{r}{\phi} \dot{\phi} = \diff{r}{\phi} \frac{l}{mr^2},\\
      \diff{r}{\phi} = \frac{r^2}{l}\sqrt{2m[E-V_e(r)]}\\
                     = \frac{r^2}{l}\sqrt{2mE - mkr^2 - \frac{l^2}{r^2}}\\
      t = \int_{0}^{t}\d{t} 
      = \int_{r_-}^{r} \d{r}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}}\sqrt{E - V_e(r)}}, \\
      \phi = \int_{0}^{\phi} \d{\phi} 
      = \int_{r_-}^{r} \d{r}\frac{l}{\sqrt{2mr^4\Bigl(E - V_e(r)\Bigr)}}.
    \end{gather*}

    An acceptable answer would be to guess a correct elliptical form $r(\phi)$ and then
    show that the differential equation is satisfied:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      r(\phi) = \frac{b}{\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2\cos^2\phi}}, \\
      \cos^2\phi = \epsilon^2\left(1-\frac{b^2}{r^2}\right) = \alpha + \beta r^{-2},\\
      \sin^2\phi = 1-\epsilon^2\left(1-\frac{b^2}{r^2}\right) = 1 - \alpha - \beta r^{-2},\\
      \diff{r}{\phi} = \frac{b\epsilon^2\cos\phi\sin\phi}{\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2\cos^2(\phi)}^3}\\
      \left(\frac{l}{r^2}\diff{r}{\phi}\right)^2 = \frac{l^2\epsilon^4\cos^2\phi\sin^2\phi}
                                                        {b^2(1-\epsilon^2\cos^2\phi)}\\
       = \frac{l^2r^2\epsilon^4}{b^4}(\alpha + \beta r^{-2})(1-\alpha - \beta r^{-2}).
    \end{gather*}
    
    Expanded, the last equation has three terms that can be matched to the terms in the
    differential equation.  A complete answer along these lines should state that
    rotational invariance allows us to rotate the coordinate system so that the form of
    the ellipse is completely general.
    
    Performing some dimensional analysis, we find the natural frequency-scale $\omega$,
    length scale $r_0$, and dimensionless constant $\epsilon$:

    \begin{gather*}
      \omega = \sqrt{k/m}, \qquad
      r_0 = \sqrt{\frac{l}{m\omega}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{l^2}{m k}},\\
      \kappa = \frac{E}{E_{\min}(r_0)} = \frac{E}{l\omega} \geq 1.
    \end{gather*}

    These give the following dimensionless integrals:

    \begin{gather*}
      V_e(r_{\pm}) = E \Longrightarrow
      1 + \left(\frac{r_{\pm}}{r_0}\right)^4 = 2\epsilon\left(\frac{r_{\pm}}{r_0}\right)^2,\\
      \omega t = \int_{r_-}^{r} \d{r}\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{E - V_e(r)}}, \\
      \phi = \int_{0}^{\phi} \d{\phi} 
      = \int_{r_-}^{r} \d{r}\frac{l}{\sqrt{2mr^4\Bigl(E - V_e(r)\Bigr)}}.
    \end{gather*}

    We can simplify these by choosing units so that $m = r_0 = \omega = 1$ (mass,
    length, time) which implies $l = 1$ and $E=\kappa$:

    \begin{gather*}
      1 + r_{\pm}^4 = 2\kappa r_{\pm}^2,\qquad
      t = -\int_{r_-}^{r} \d{r}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\kappa - r^{-2} - r^2}}, \\
      \phi = -\int_{r_-}^{r} \d{r}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\kappa r^4 - r^2 - r^6}}.
    \end{gather*}

    These can be computed, but instead, we turn to the Binet equation which allows for a
    simpler derivation.
    
    :::
    
    :::{solution} Alternative Solution: Binet Equation
    
    An alternative formulation of the solution is in terms of the [Binet
    Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet_equation) discussed in class:

    \begin{gather*}
      F(r) = -k r = -\frac{k}{u} = -\frac{l^2}{m}u^2\left(\diff[2]{u}{\phi} 
      + u \right).
    \end{gather*}

    With $u' = u'(\phi)$, we have:

    \begin{gather*}
      \frac{km}{l^2} = \frac{1}{r_0^4} = u^3(u'' + u).
    \end{gather*}

    Although this is not too hard to solve, since we expect the solution to be an
    ellipse centered on the origin, we might guess the form of the solution in terms of
    $x + \I y = u^{-1}e^{\I\phi}$ with

    \begin{gather*}
      \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \\
      u(\phi) = \sqrt{\frac{\cos^2(\phi)}{a^2} + \frac{\sin^2(\phi)}{b^2}}
              = \frac{1}{ab\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{a^2+b^2 - (a^2-b^2)\cos(2\phi)}
      ,\\
      u''(\phi) + u(\phi) = \frac{2 \sqrt{2} ab}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2 - (a^2-b^2)\cos(2\phi)}^3}
                          = \frac{1}{a^2b^2u^3(\phi)}.
    \end{gather*}

    Hence, we have a solution provided $ab = r_0^{2}$, or $a = r_0e^{\xi}$ and $b =
    r_0e^{-\xi}$ as we are asked to verify.  To complete the solution, we use the
    initial condition that $b = r_-$ and $a = r_+$ at the turning points, so that 

    \begin{gather*}
      \frac{b^2}{a^2} = 1 - \epsilon^2 = e^{-2\xi} = \frac{u_+^2}{u_-^2}
      = \frac{\kappa + \sqrt{\kappa^2 -1}}{\kappa - \sqrt{\kappa^2 -1}},\\
      \kappa = \frac{e^{\xi} + e^{-\xi}}{2} = \cosh \xi.
    \end{gather*}

    The final solution is

    \begin{gather*}
      u(\phi) = r_0^{-1}\sqrt{\cosh(2\xi) - \sinh(2\xi)\cos(2\phi)}.
    \end{gather*}

    The period can be computed from:

    \begin{gather*}
      T_\phi = \int_0^{2\pi}\d{\phi}\;\frac{1}{\dot{\phi}}
             = \frac{m}{l}\int_0^{2\pi}\d{\phi}\;u^{-2}(\phi)
             = \frac{mr_0^2}{l}\int_0^{2\pi}\d{\phi}\;
              \frac{1}{\cosh(2\xi) - \sinh(2\xi)\cos(2\phi)}
            = \frac{2 \pi mr_0^2}{l}
              \frac{1}{\sqrt{\cosh^2(2\xi) - \sinh^2(2\xi)}}
            = \frac{2 \pi mr_0^2}{l} = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}
    \end{gather*}

    which is independent of $\xi$ as we expected from our initial analysis.  *(To do the
    integral we have used the following:)*

    \begin{gather*}
      \int_0^{2\pi}\d{\phi} \frac{1}{a + b \cos(2\phi)} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}.
    \end{gather*}
    
    In the limit of $E \rightarrow E_{\min}$ we have $\kappa \approx 1 +
    \xi^2/2\rightarrow 1$ so that $\xi \ll 1$ and 

    \begin{gather*}
      r_0 u(\phi) \rightarrow \sqrt{1 - 2\xi\cos(2\phi)} \approx 1 - \xi\cos(2\phi).
    \end{gather*}

    Hence, the orbit becomes circular with a small perturbation.  This is easily seen by
    looking at the ratio $b/a = e^{-2\xi} \rightarrow 1$.  In the limit $E \gg E_{\min}$
    we have $\xi \gg 1$ so that $b/a \rightarrow 0$ and the orbit becomes highly
    eccentric.

    :::

3. Prove that the period is independent of the energy and angular momentum.  Could you
    have anticipated this from simple arguments? Discuss the significance of this result.
   
    :::{solution}
    
    See the first solution to part 2 above.
    
    Some people discuss the change in the area inscribed by the orbit $\d{A} =
    r^2\d{\phi}/2$. *(You can think of this as a triangle with height $r$ and base
    $r\d{\phi}$ -- the correction due to $\d{r}$ is of higher order.)*
    This is related to the conserved angular momentum $l = mr^2\dot{\phi}$:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      \diff{A}{t} = \frac{r^2}{2}\dot{\phi} = \frac{l}{2m}.
    \end{gather*}
    
    This is Kepler's equal area law, which relates the area of the ellipse to the
    period.  The area of an ellipse is $A = \pi a b$ where the major and minor axes
    $a=r_+$ and $b=r_-$ satisfy:
    
    \begin{gather*}
      E = V_e(r) = \frac{kr^2}{2} + \frac{l^2}{2mr^2},\\
      0 = mkr^4 + l^2 - 2mEr^2 = mk(r-r_-^2)(r-r_+^2),\\
      r_-r_+ = \sqrt{\frac{l^2}{mk}} = \frac{l}{\sqrt{mk}}.
    \end{gather*}

    This explicitly shows that the area is independent of $E$,
    
    \begin{gather*}
      A = \frac{lT}{2m} = \pi ab = \pi \frac{l}{\sqrt{km}},\\
      T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}.
    \end{gather*}
    
    Hence, the period is is indeed independent of the amplitude.

:::{solution}

To derive Snell's law, consider $V(x, y) = -V_0\Theta(x)$ with the boundary along the
$y$ axis.  The force $\vect{F} = -\vect{\nabla}V = V_0\delta(x)\uvect{x}$ has no
$y$-component, so $p_y$, and energy are conserved.

|        | $x<0$                          | $x>0$                                |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Momentum| $(p_x, p_y)$                   | $(q_x, p_y)$                         |
|Energy  | $E=\frac{m}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2)$ | $E=\frac{m}{2}(q_x^2 + p_y^2) - V_0$ |
|Angle   | $\theta_i$                     | $\theta_r$                           |

This gives:

\begin{align*}
  q_x^2 &= p_x^2 + \frac{2V_0}{m},\\
  \sin{\theta_i} &= \frac{p_y}{\sqrt{p_x^2+p_y^2}},\\
  \sin{\theta_r} &= \frac{p_y}{\sqrt{q_x^2+p_y^2}}
                  = \frac{p_y}{\sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + \frac{2V_0}{m}}},\\
  \frac{\sin\theta_i}{\sin\theta_r} 
      &= \sqrt{1 + \frac{2V_0}{m(p_x^2 + p_y^2)}}
       = \sqrt{1 + \frac{V_0}{E}} = n
\end{align*}

Thus, we have proved Snell's law with an effective index of refraction
$n=\sqrt{(E+V_0)/E}$ as advertised.

Here is the geometry of the problem.

![Scattering Solution](Scattering.png)

Below we check our solution numerically.  (Note: there was a transcription error in the original
statement of $\d{\sigma}/\d{\Omega}$.  The book is correct as our code below shows.)  We
draw the scattered rays to make sure everything looks reasonable.

Integrating this gives

\begin{gather*}
  \sigma = \int \diff{\sigma}{\Omega}\d\Omega =
  \int_{0}^{\theta_{\max}}\!\!\!\!\!
    2\pi\sin\theta \d{\theta}\;
    \frac{\bigl[n\cos(\tfrac{1}{2}\theta) - 1\bigr](n-\cos\tfrac{1}{2}\theta)}
         {(1 + n^2 - 2n \cos\tfrac{1}{2}\theta)^2}
   = \pi a^2.
\end{gather*}

Note: we must be careful to limit the integrand to the range of the maximally scattered
ray:

\begin{gather*}
  \theta_\max = 2\sin^{-1}\frac{1}{n} - \pi.
\end{gather*}
